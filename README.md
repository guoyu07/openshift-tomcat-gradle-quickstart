Stock Tomcat with Gradle
========================

This is a Stock Apache Tomcat together with Gradle Quickstart for the Redhat OpenShift platform.

Look at the action hooks to understand the steps customized and change the version of Gradle and Apache Tomcat there easily.

The OpenShift `diy` cartridge documentation can be found at:

http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_guide.html#diy

So this quickstart is a combination of the work of Shekhar Gulati at https://www.openshift.com/blogs/run-gradle-builds-on-openshift with the code at https://github.com/shekhargulati/gradle-openshift-quickstart and the tomcat quickstart https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/openshift-tomcat-quickstart

I chose not to put the binaries of the tomcat into the git repository though.
